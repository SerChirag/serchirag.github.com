Hello There! My name is Chirag Vashist. I am a Ph.D. student at Simon Fraser University, Burnaby. I am affiliated with APEX Lab and my advisor is [Dr. Ke Li](https://www.sfu.ca/~keli/).

Before this, I worked as a Software Engineer at Microsoft in the domain of [Digital Security and Risk](https://github.com/azsk/AzTS-docs). I received my B.Tech. Honors degree in Computer Science from Indian Institute of Technology, Mandi.

In spare time, I like to have [fun](https://unsplash.com/@serchirag) with my Nikon D5600.
